  ## Description of the Project 

  This is a simple program that asks you a series of "Would You Rather" questions. Each time you play, the questions are different as this project makes calls to a 3rd party API server with 1000+ questions! Play along with friends or question your sanity!

  ## Problems faced when working on the project 
 
  I initially had problems with the API as my API key kept failing. After some deep troubleshooting, everything was smooth sailing.  

  ## Main takeaways from the project 

  I learned how to make API calls to a 3rd party server again and how to destructure an object for better use cases.
